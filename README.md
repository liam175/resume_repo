# Repos I Am Proud Of

1.https://github.com/TeamSteamRobotics/SteamEngine_1.0

This project was my baby, I spent many night fixing bug and engineering solutions. The main jar runsthe actual SteamEngine which collects data, turns it into jsons and displays it while the apk is an android app that is given to scouters, it holds 4 rounds of data that then gets scanned into the jar application and turned into jsons. This is by far my favorite project and the one i am most proud of. 

2. https://github.com/liam175/Arduino

While some of the code is arguably bad its shows the amount of arduino projects i did between the ages of 10 and 13 and if put in order (which it is not) shows my improvement with the fundemntals of programing.
    
3. https://github.com/liam175/Lcollider

This repo holds 3 version of my Lcollider "library". it is a box colider based physics engine i was planning on making browser games with. the project layed a good foundation for the python librarys i write now and the math behind kinimatics.

if you are able to get past my bad spelling i feel like you can see how this code for unity games has influenced the way i structure my code now.
